# The-Fancy-Player

                                                          NOTE
This project was developed during the early years of programming journey, therefore so many things with the code and design are wrong.
You can look at my recent projects if you are looking to learn about my experience.

Here are some notes that might be useful. You can read this file again in its installation location (Default Path :program files(x86)): 


* You will need to reference Bunifu framework in order to read or change its source code. https://devtools.bunifu.co.ke/

* To install the The Fancy Player, run the installer at : SetupWizard -> The Fancy Player Installer.msi

* To change the interface size to the smaller version, click to orange menu button at the top left. To minimize it click to the arrow at the left side of the top panel. 

* Keep the exe file with all other files that the installation folder contains. If you want to change its location, create a shortcut.

* If you find a bug or you have a request feel free to send them to me via the "Contac " button on the application.

* If the Multimedia keys don't work while playing some games, run this program as administrator.

* If you've changed the picture at the left top and want default picture back, delete the "CustomImageLocation.dat" file 
You can find it in "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\TheFancyPlayer" 
( you might need to choose " show hidden files " from file explorer.)

* You can uninstall in its install location by clicking "Uninstall".
