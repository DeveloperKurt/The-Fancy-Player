          -------------------Thanks for using this fancy music player!--------------------


Here are some notes that might be useful. You can read this file again in its installation location (Default Path :program files(x86)):

You will need to reference Bunifu framework in order to read or change its source code. https://devtools.bunifu.co.ke/

To install the The Fancy Player, run the installer at : SetupWizard -> The Fancy Player Installer.msi

To change the interface size to the smaller version, click to orange menu button at top left. To minimize it click to arrow at left side of the top panel.

Keep the exe file with all other files that the installation folder contains. If you want to change it's location, make a shortcut.

If you find a bug or you have a request feel free to send them to me via the "Contac " button on the application.

If the Multi media keys don't work while playing some games, run this program as administrator.

If you've changed the picture at left top and want default picture back, delete the "CustomImageLocation.dat" file You can find it in "C:\Users%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\TheFancyPlayer" ( you might need to choose " show hidden files " from file explorer.)

You can uninstall in its install location by clicking "Uninstall".
